# HousePricePredict
This project focuses on predicting laptop prices using various machine learning techniques. The dataset contains different specifications and features of laptops, and the goal is to build an accurate predictive model. To achieve this, several algorithms, including linear regression, ridge regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble methods, were employed.

The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn were utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks. Additionally, Optuna was implemented for optimizing hyperparameters efficiently.
